4. Engineering design advantage for the  JJJ ( made of CCC ) :
Our people have a good knowledge and full grasp of various PEB specifications and international codes, which are predominant building specifications and standards in America, Europe and worldwide, such as BS, MBMA, AISC, AISI and so forth. We have fully developed a proprietary technical system that targets the tasks of PEB engineering, engineering optimization, and further engineering. Our engineering people are also versed in utilization and application of main-stream commercial design software including STAAD, SAP2000, PKPM, STRUCAD, XSTEEL etc. 
Our company owes its competitiveness, in great part, to its flexibility, efficiency and optimization of designs for structure and cladding. Our structural engineers are not only masters in terms of structural design, but also extremely professional and skillful in cladding system design. They are intimately familiar with categories, functions, combinations and applications of different types of roof and wall panels. Therefore the building system we offer our customers is simply more human-friendly, safer and more cost-effective and features greater architectural beauty.

5. Packaging & Shipping for  JJJ ( made of CCC ) :
1) Using container: 
container of 20 feet, and container of 40 feet
2) By sea for batch goods, for container or bulk-cargo ship, port receiving.
3) Customers specifying freight forwarder or negotiable shipping methods 
4) All of the steel column& beams ends and plates will be packed by the blanket to protect them from the crash in the container during the shipment. 
5) To make the loading and unloading more efficiently and saving the delivery cost, 40' OT is preferred to loading the steel frames. 
6) All the wall and roof panels will be filmed by two sides and fixed stably in the 40HQ container. 
7) All the windows and doors will be protected by the bubble rapping papers and fixed stably in the container.

6. FAQ:
1) How about the derust grade of your  JJJ ( made of CCC ) ? 
Reply: Ball blasting Sa2.5 on main steel structure or by Galvanized frame; 
manual derust St2.5 on secondary steel structure. 

2) What kind of panel used for the roof and wall ? 
Reply: Color corrugated steel sheet and sandwich panel could be used. Sandwich panel performs well on the heat insulation, sound insulation. Common sandwich materials are EPS, glass wool and PU sandwich panels. 

3) Are  JJJ ( made of CCC ) expensive ? 
Answer: The steel structure of our company is economic. Its technology and materials used decreases waste expenses such as wood, decorative stone, brick etc. All the material including the steel frames, wall body and roof for installation are prefabricated during the production process, therefore the labor costs for installation is decreased.
