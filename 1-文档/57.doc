4. Engineering design advantage for the  JJJ ( made of CCC ) :
Our people have a good knowledge and full grasp of various PEB specifications and international codes, which are predominant building specifications and standards in America, Europe and worldwide, such as BS, MBMA, AISC, AISI and so forth. We have fully developed a proprietary technical system that targets the tasks of PEB engineering, engineering optimization, and further engineering. Our engineering people are also versed in utilization and application of main-stream commercial design software including STAAD, SAP2000, PKPM, STRUCAD, XSTEEL etc. 
Our company owes its competitiveness, in great part, to its flexibility, efficiency and optimization of designs for structure and cladding. Our structural engineers are not only masters in terms of structural design, but also extremely professional and skillful in cladding system design. They are intimately familiar with categories, functions, combinations and applications of different types of roof and wall panels. Therefore the building system we offer our customers is simply more human-friendly, safer and more cost-effective and features greater architectural beauty.

5. Packaging & Shipping for  JJJ ( made of CCC ) :
1) Using container: 
container of 20 feet, and container of 40 feet
