3. Project case- 10000 tons heavy steel structure for Indian cement plant Project:
Description:
The whole steel consumption of this is more than 10000 tons, Among which, the steel consumption of steel roofing truss for steel structure homogenization silo and structural steel bunker is about 7000 tons. 
Raw materials silo, clinker materials silo, electricity dust removal, pre-heater and other structures, together with steel structure buildings for subsidiary equipment, total steel structure components reach approximately 3, 000 tons. 

4. Engineering design advantage for the  JJJ ( made of CCC ) :
Our people have a good knowledge and full grasp of various PEB specifications and international codes, which are predominant building specifications and standards in America, Europe and worldwide, such as BS, MBMA, AISC, AISI and so forth. We have fully developed a proprietary technical system that targets the tasks of PEB engineering, engineering optimization, and further engineering. Our engineering people are also versed in utilization and application of main-stream commercial design software including STAAD, SAP2000, PKPM, STRUCAD, XSTEEL etc. 
Our company owes its competitiveness, in great part, to its flexibility, efficiency and optimization of designs for structure and cladding. Our structural engineers are not only masters in terms of structural design, but also extremely professional and skillful in cladding system design. They are intimately familiar with categories, functions, combinations and applications of different types of roof and wall panels. Therefore the building system we offer our customers is simply more human-friendly, safer and more cost-effective and features greater architectural beauty.

5. Packaging & Shipping for  JJJ ( made of CCC ) :
1) Using container: 
container of 20 feet, and container of 40 feet
2) By sea for batch goods, for container or bulk-cargo ship, port receiving.
3) Customers specifying freight forwarder or negotiable shipping methods 
4) All of the steel column& beams ends and plates will be packed by the blanket to protect them from the crash in the container during the shipment. 
5) To make the loading and unloading more efficiently and saving the delivery cost, 40' OT is preferred to loading the steel frames. 
6) All the wall and roof panels will be filmed by two sides and fixed stably in the 40HQ container. 
7) All the windows and doors will be protected by the bubble rapping papers and fixed stably in the container.

6. FAQ:
1) Common type of the industrial building you supply ? 
Portal frame is the usual type in the industrial workshop and warehouse shed, other types like lattice structure, space structure, etc also could be designed and manufacturer as per customers request. 

2) What is the quality grade of the  JJJ ( made of CCC ) ? 
Q345 is used for main steel structure, Q235 is used for secondary steel structure. 
Also we could use international steel as per your demand if order qty is big enough. 

3) How about the delivery time for your  JJJ ( made of CCC ) ? 
Usually, within 30-45 days after the order confirmed, also depends on the fabrication quantity.
